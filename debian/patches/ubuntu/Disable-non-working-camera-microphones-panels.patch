Subject: Disable non working camera/microphones panels

Upstream: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/issues/381
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/741
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/cheese/-/issues/95

Even with improved text from the original implementation, the panel
doesn't seem to work with Snap apps. I disabled the camera and microphone
here and the Zoom snap still works and it isn't listed as an app
"requesting permission".
